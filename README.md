year2_sem1_algorithms_lab1

To run a program (build all graphics) you should call function main in module main.py. Module sorting_algorithms_number_of_operations.py includes sorting algorithms which return
number of comparisons. Module sorting_algorithms.py includes just sorting algotirhms. Modules number_of_operations_comparison.py and time_comparison.py
consists of functions whch represents the experiments of this lab, and which count the number of comparisons and time of running algorithms.
